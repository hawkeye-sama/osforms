# OSForms Facts (Marketing Source of Truth)

## Core Philosophy
- **MIT Licensed:** Free to use, modify, and host.
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys):** No middleman markups. Use your own Resend, GCP, or SMTP keys.
- **Data Sovereignty:** You own your submissions. No vendor lock-in.
- **Headless First:** Works with any frontend stack (Next.js, Astro, Svelte, HTML).

## Current Features (Verified in Code)
- **Auth:** Google OAuth and Magic Link (OTP) via Resend.
- **Integrations:**
  - **Resend:** Send submission alerts to your inbox.
  - **Google Sheets:** Sync submissions to a spreadsheet in real-time.
  - **Webhooks:** (In development/Phase 1)
- **Dashboard:** Modern Next.js UI for managing forms and API keys.
- **Security:** CSRF protection and (Phase 1) Honeypots.

## Killer Features (The "Why")
1. **Unlimited for Free:** Since you use your own keys, you aren't hit with "submission limits" or "file upload taxes."
2. **Setup Speed:** Go from `<form>` to inbox in <2 minutes.
3. **Privacy:** Submissions are stored and forwarded using your own keys.

## Tone of Voice
- **Technical & Direct:** No "marketing speak." Talk like a developer to a developer.
- **Empowering:** Focus on autonomy and control.
- **Movement-Oriented:** We are the antidote to "SaaS Tax."
