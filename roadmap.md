# 🗺️ Product Roadmap & Community Goals

The mission of **osforms** is to provide a headless, developer-first form backend that empowers users to own their data. We prioritize features that eliminate "feature taxes" found in commercial alternatives.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The "Trust & Utility" Layer (Current Focus)
**Goal:** Make the API production-ready and unblock custom workflows.

| Feature | Importance | Why it helps user acquisition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Honeypot & CORS** | High | Prevents spam. Trust is the #1 requirement for dev tools. |
| **Webhooks** | High | Unlocks "Programmability." Connects to Slack, Discord, or custom apps. |
| **Custom Redirects** | Medium | Essential for standard HTML forms (marketing sites). |
| **Auto-Responders** | Medium | Closes the loop. Send a "We got your message" email via Resend. |

## 🟡 Phase 2: The "BYOK" Value Unlock
**Goal:** Disrupt the market by offering "Enterprise" features for free using User Keys.

| Feature | Importance | Why it helps user acquisition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Drive Uploads** | Very High | **Our "Killer Feature."** Free file uploads (unlimited) via user's GCP. |
| **Data Export (CSV/JSON)** | High | Shows developers they own their data. Prevents vendor lock-in. |
| **Advanced Rate Limiting**| Medium | Protects our infra and user's Resend quotas from abuse. |
| **Submission Dashboard** | Medium | A clean UI to browse and filter results (replaces manual Sheet checking). |

## 🔵 Phase 3: Community & Expansion
**Goal:** Build the ecosystem and invite outside contributors.

| Feature | Importance | Why it helps user acquisition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native Integrations** | Medium | One-click Slack, Discord, and Notion buttons for non-coders. |
| **Visual Code Generator**| Low | Help users "copy-paste" their way to a working form. |
| **CLI Tool** | Low | Manage forms and keys from the terminal (Dev-favored). |
| **Self-Hosting Docs** | Medium | Detailed guides for users to run their own instance on Vercel/Railway. |
